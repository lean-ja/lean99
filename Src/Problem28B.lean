/- # Problem 28B

(Intermediate 🌟🌟) Again, we suppose that a list contains elements that are lists themselves. But this time the objective is to sort the elements of this list according to their **length frequency**; i.e., in the default, where sorting is done ascendingly, lists with rare lengths are placed first, others with a more frequent length come later.

variable {α : Type}

/-- Insert an element in a way that
does not break the order of the sorted list. -/
def orderedInsert (a : α) (ord : α → Nat) : List α → List α
  | [] => [a]
  | b :: l =>
    if ord a ≤ ord b then a :: b :: l
    else b :: orderedInsert a ord l

/-- insertion sort -/
def insertionSort (ord : α → Nat) : List α → List α
  | [] => []
  | b :: l => orderedInsert b ord <| insertionSort ord l

-- You can use this!
#check insertionSort
--#--
/-- Count the number of lists in list `l` that have the same length as `target` -/
def makeToLengthFreq (l : List (List α)) (target : List α) : Nat :=
  let lengthList := l.map (·.length)
  lengthList.filter (· = target.length) |>.length
--#--

def lfsort (l : List (List α)) : List (List α) :=
  -- sorry
  insertionSort (makeToLengthFreq l) l
  -- sorry

-- The following codes are for test and you should not edit these.

#guard lfsort ([[]] : List (List String)) = [[]]

#guard lfsort [[1, 2], [1], [1, 2]] = [[1], [1, 2], [1, 2]]

#guard lfsort [[1, 2], [1], [2, 3]] = [[1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]
